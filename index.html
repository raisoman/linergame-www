								how a modern complex container shipping line runs its business using vessels and containers made out of <span id="lego2">LEGO<sup>TM *</sup></span> combined with a paper based flow of documentation 
								in a small scale setup. 
								During the game, the team will take responsibility for core commercial and operational tasks of a container shipping line, 
								including vital terminal tasks, and through teamwork they can maximize carrier profitability. 
								Each player gets to play all the different roles in the game by rotating and get the opportunity to collaborate directly with a number of the other participants.
								Depending on the prior experience of the players a full game takes between a half and a complete day to play. Shorter sessions can be arranged by simply reducing the number of rounds to be played and. As the gameplay is quite intense, it can be of interest to combine a session with lectures on liner operations, revenue management, container stowage, process improvement,
								performance management, strategy and competitive advantage in the liner shipping industry and more.
